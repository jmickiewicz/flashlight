# flashlight
I had the idea of a modular light with seperable light source, programable control, power source, and other parts as desired such as detector to allow communication, or a radio to support solo heliographing, not all uses would use all parts.  

phase 1 lightle
create a usb powered LED light suitable to connect to common usb batteries. The light ought to be able to recieve control signals from usb, and modulate color and intensity.

phase 1b battery
obtain a battery pack well suited to this project.

phase 2 control
create a low-ish power modular that can plug in line between the battery and light to digitally control the light. The control ought to be able to communicate using a appropriate detector without interfering with human visual use.
it'd be cool if it could handle persistnce of vision maybe with a position tracker so waving the light could write a message or picture.
it should have spare connectors to link other moduals together

phase 2b detector 
obtain a detector able to recieve communication from the light and pass it on to the control.
